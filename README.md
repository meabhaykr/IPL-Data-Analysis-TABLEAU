# IPL Data Analysis With TABLEAU

## Exploring IPL Dataset through Tableau Visualization

**Introduction**
The Indian Premier League (IPL), a prestigious T20 cricket league established in 2008, has garnered immense popularity worldwide. This league features a dynamic blend of domestic and international players, represented by eight teams from different Indian cities. The tournament structure includes a double round-robin format followed by playoffs, making it a thrilling event.

**Objective**
We have at our disposal two comprehensive datasets:
1. **IPL Matches 2008-2020.csv**: This dataset furnishes a detailed account of each match conducted in IPL from 2008 to 2020.
2. **IPL Ball-by-Ball 2008-2020.csv**: This dataset is a goldmine of ball-by-ball information for all matches in the given timeframe.

**Data Exploration**

**Match Insights**
1. **Toss Influence on Match Outcome**: We'll delve into how the toss result correlates with the final match result for each venue. This will provide insights into whether winning the toss provides a significant advantage in different grounds.
2. **Dominant Victories**: Identifying the matches with the most extensive victory margins (in terms of runs and wickets) will uncover memorable performances in the history of IPL.
3. **Record-Breaking Scores**: By identifying the highest team totals across all seasons, we can showcase the most remarkable batting performances.

**Player Analysis**
1. **Orange Cap Contenders**: Highlighting the top run-scorers of each season, we'll identify the players who consistently outperformed with the bat.
2. **Purple Cap Contenders**: Spotlighting the leading wicket-takers in every season, we can acknowledge the bowlers who consistently dominated the field.
3. **Boundary Hitters**: Visualizing players who hit the maximum number of fours and sixes in both specific seasons and overall will demonstrate the aggressive side of IPL batting.

**Team Performance**
1. **Season-wise Team Analysis**: By examining the ratio of wins to losses, we can chart the performance trajectory of each team across different seasons.
2. **Home vs. Away Win Percentage**: Analyzing the win percentage for teams in home and away matches will reveal the influence of venue on team performance.

Through Tableau, we will craft engaging and insightful visualizations that bring these analyses to life. The power of data visualization will allow us to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and stories within the vast IPL dataset, making it accessible and enjoyable for sports enthusiasts and data aficionados alike.
